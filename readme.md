# N2O4

A build system as library.

N2O4 is an idea grew out of fiddling [n2](https://github.com/evmar/n2).
Less ninjutsu, more oxidizer.

## Design notes

- **Not** `ninja`-compatibility-first.
- Improved ergonomics as a library, not as an executable.
- Be efficient with common cases, allow callbacks instead of forcing process calls everywhere.

N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is also called nitrogen tetroxide (NTO)
when using as a propellant,
so in theory it's also "into".
