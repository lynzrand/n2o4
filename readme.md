A build system as library.

`n2o4` is an idea grew out of fiddling [n2](https://github.com/evmar/n2).
Less ninjutsu, more oxidizer.

## Design & rationale

For low-level build graph executors like Make and Ninja,
the build graph itself is implicit, based on artifacts generated by each build command.
However, when writing build systems for high-level languages,
it's often easier to think in the relationship between build command themselves,
instead of writing the artifacts they generate and parsing it back to the graph.

`n2o4` is a project that tries to explore build system design ideas from here:

- An embedded build graph executor that runs in-memory graphs.
- Works directly on build nodes and the edges connecting them.
  Files are only for determining the up-to-dateness of nodes.
- Build environment agnostic. Mock the world if you like.
- First-class callbacks as build commands.

`n2o4` also differs from `n2` significantly.
In particular, `n2o4` is not optimized for Ninja compatibility,
and aims for better ergonomics as a library & in-memory graph usage.

## World and Database

`n2o4` provides different world (file system and process spawning) and build database implementations
to accommodate different build environments and needs.

Worlds:

- `n2o4::LocalWorld` -- The default world implementation,
  working on the local file system and process space.
- (Test only) `tests/mock.rs::MockWorld` -- A mocked world for testing.

Databases:

- `n2o4::db::in_memory::InMemoryDb` -- An in-memory database implementation,
  mainly for testing, but can be used for ephemeral builds.
- `n2o4::db::redb::ExecRedb` -- A [`redb`][redb]-backed filesystem database implementation.
- `n2o4_heed::ExecHeedDb` -- A [LMDB][](via [`heed`][heed])-backed filesystem database implementation.

[heed]: https://crates.io/crates/heed

## CLI and `ninja`

The `n2o4` commandline executable, located in `cli/`,
is used for testing and stressing the library.
It contains a subset of `ninja` for testing with the library and tweaking on ergonomics.

You may use it either as `n2o4 ninja [ninja_args...]`
or create a symlink whose name starts with `ninja` and use it as a replacement.

Unsupported features:

- Dry run
- Printing commands executed
- Advanced `ninja` features like pools, response files, depfile/dyndep, etc.

N<sub>2</sub>O<sub>4</sub> is also called nitrogen tetroxide (NTO)
when using as a propellant,
so in theory it's also "into", just like `n2`.
